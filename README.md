# Structured and time series analysis for Rossman kaggle competition &middot;
> The program follows a similar structure as one demonstrated in fastai courses

The Project provides a step by step method to predict sales for a given date for a given store and goes deeper into understanding data and their relationships to improve the accuracy of the models developed. The project is an attempt to the Kaggle competition for [Rossman Store Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales#description)

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

## Installing / Getting started

You need to use fastai 0.7; please follow the installation instructions [here](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v0-install-issues-thread/24652)  .


## Developing

### Built With
fastai 0.7, sklearn libraries

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.
NVidia GPU with programming framework CUDA is helpful for training and testing the models

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

Set the PATH variable to your relavant folder location
```shell
git clone https://github.com/anandpuntambekar/Structured_Data.git
cd data/
```


## Style guide

The notebook is well commented explaining in technical details each and every step of the process end to end. This includes exploring the data, Model exploration, Model selection, Model tuning, Model testing and analysing the results

## Database
